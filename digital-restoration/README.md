#Digitization and Reconstruction
### Thursday 20th, Monda Hess

**Why?**
"Documentation is essential in the practice of conservation"

The [Enumerate report](http://www.enumerate.eu/) states that "50% of heritage objects are 3D, 0.1% of these objects are digitized"

When it comes to digitization we should ask ourselves, what are the user needs? Thinking of all the disciplines, all the specialisms and all the object types.

A 3D digital surrogate must have the closest fidelity to the actual object that can be acheived digitally. This would depict a detialed colour, against a different backgroun in which the shape and size is easily discernable. However, it is very difficult to record things like surface gloss, for example, the shinyness of a gilded frame.

Things to consider when printing 3d rendered objects

- what is the artefact in question
- what is the professionals spec
- what is the 3d aquisition mode (how will it be scanned)
- will it be digitally restored and how?
- how will it be archived and disseiminated

A 3D print takes points from a laser scan and forms it into a laser type mesh, created through triangles. As such, detail will always be lost. Another thing to bear in mind, is that on printed the Z axis will often be compressed.

Authorship in 3D prints are very similar to photographs, it belongs to the person who created it, not what it was modelled on.
