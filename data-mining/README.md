'mete-data' is basically information about the data, this could be author, publishing date ect ect. The 'meta data' is often the way we find the data.

###[CIDOC CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/)
An association of major museums across Europe which created a formal model of describing museum artefacts. This is a computer language (ish) which has gradually been extended to cover different aspects like provenance. Much like the evolution of all languages really.
It is a Conceptual Reference Model
It sits inside a DB and helps the search for things.

Fun fact, 'corpus' is the plural for text

##Text Mining Charters
Free text data is something which studies text in sentances, instead of fields in databases.
The [Traces Through Time](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/our-role/plans-policies-performance-and-projects/our-projects/traces-through-time/) project is built with Neo4JS graph database specification and is written in cypher.
