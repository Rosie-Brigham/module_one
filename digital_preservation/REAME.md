# Digital Heritage
## Mureen E. Pennock



**documentary heritage**  form of information attached to a carrier (modern language written down on paper, or on film ect) Generally portable, and typically reproduceable - copied for preservation purposes. I can be preserved, because it's the information not the carrier

**digital heritage** - 'unique resources of human knowledge and expression created digitally or converted into digital form from existing analoude resources',  There are overlaps here with other types of heritage, but technology is the inherent shared element.

- convervation, restoration && preseervation
- access and interpretaion
- developing innovative technology
- enabling new relationships
