# Digital Heritage
## Mureen E. Pennock



**documentary heritage**  form of information attached to a carrier (modern language written down on paper, or on film ect) Generally portable, and typically reproduceable - copied for preservation purposes. I can be preserved, because it's the information not the carrier

**digital heritage** - 'unique resources of human knowledge and expression created digitally or converted into digital form from existing analoude resources',  There are overlaps here with other types of heritage, but technology is the inherent shared element.

- convervation, restoration && preseervation
- access and interpretaion
- developing innovative technology
- enabling new relationships

*digital pictures of paintings*
extension of original value, representation of the artefact

due to the tech changes, surely it's the concept that is the heritage, which evolves over time...

*curious travellers*
exists to encourage people to take photos and upload them to the website, where they can put together 3d scans of sites.

Digital preservation - *the series of actions and interventions required to ensure continued and reliable access to authentic digital objects for as long as they are deemed to be of value*
