# Digitsation & Imaging
**Keats Webb, Thursday 20th**

The Smithsonian is *designed to increase knowledge*, and so creating a robust digital plan and strategy is very important.
It has 138 million objects, 20 museums, 157,000 cubic feet of archival material, 2 million library volunes and only 1% is on display.
It's goal in digitasation is to "share our resources to the world"

**Initiatives**:

Due to the vastness of the collections however, only 10% is planned to be digitzed.
Catalouge, exhibition photography and conservation imagery has been digitised
the Digitization program office oversees mass digitization, 3D and policy.

## Imaging
### 1890 - X-ray
X-ray was used in the 1890s to x-ray cool mummies.
It's a really great tool to get information of the whole depth of the object.

### 1930 - IR and UV
Film is sensitive to wavelengths either side of the visible light spectrum.
*UV* is great for materials, restorations and past treatments as they react differently to UV radiation
*IR* is useful to identify underdrawings

### 1960 IR reflectography
Improved detectibility of underdrawing - refine and improve the above technologies

### 1970-80's, digital images
and the ability to manipulate and process digital data

### 1980/90s, multispectural imagery
- imaging spectroscopy
- sequence of images accquired by consercutively with bandwidths of tens of thousand of nanometers

### 1980's, 3D imaging
- allows you to capture geometry, volume and textute

###  2000, Hyperspectral imagine
Like above, but more intense with more bandwidths
This is a small iamge that has to be stuck together

UV visible flourescence is when you use UV to excited the materials to flouresce, which you can then capture with a normal camera in the visible light spectrum


**2.5D**
Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI)
This is basically lots of light positions, mapped onto one image, that you can play with and look at the shadows in order to determing patterns. Really good to frieze type objects
