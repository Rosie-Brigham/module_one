## Material Examination
How can we use chemical analysis to help with provenance and dating?
Or even, to inform us how the object was used, can we gain a history of the object; the story of the human behaviour from the material eveidence?

When looking at objects we must be aware of our own subjectivity, it's easy for us to see change as a effort to strive for improvement, however - the concept of continuous improvement is a fairly post 1600 englightment way of thinking. In the medieval, the idea of improving and changing is quite revolutionary!

### Stained Glass

If we look at a typical 'stained glass window', there's quite a lot going on - it contains coloured glass, shading and painting. Stained referes to the idea of the glass being painted, however - a lot of glass is actually just coloured. Yellow is often 'stained', yet blue is often just made blue. Some of the paint was low temperature paint that was fired on, such as iron and lead.

Stained glass has been widely used in the west since the 12th centure, though it has been used in windows in both west and near east since about the 7th century.

Stained glass decays in a big way - (though wether it will do at the same rate now th atmosphere has been cleaned post 1950s is debateable. The sulphur in the atmosphere through the industrial period was quite bad...)

Essentially, it is glass sand and alkali:
Soda lime silica glass (or natron glass) is found in antiquity. This glass has a low melting temperature, low amount or iron (which makes it clear) and high silica content which makes it durable.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
|Silica | SiO2 | 70% |
|Soda | NaO2 | 17% |

The sodium carbonate and sodium sulphate alkali came from egyptian lakes. They could be harvested at the end of summer and made into large blocks, then sold to glassmakers. Glass was made around th general mederterainian area, then broken up and exported.

Coloured glass was found in the sion church in the 5th-6th century, as well as in mosques in Jordon (twas not just a christian decoration!)

Glassmakers ran out of natron in around the 8-9th century. Things happened and the trade routes collapsed which meant getting to the shores of egypt were no longer quite so easy. The last place that it's found is San Vicenzo at Volturno. However, here quite a lot of glass seems to have been melted from old mosaics.

**One way we know**, is by looking at coloured glass, blue in particular (yaaay). Cobalt was hard to get, so glass for windows was attained by simply re-using old roman glass.
* This happened when they ran out of sourcing soda in the east. Thus, the baths of Corinth were stripped for their glass.

*850 AD was around the end of natron glass*

Glassmakers started to use ash instead (mainly from ferns) which was sodium rich. So, from the 8th-11th century, new glass produced was made using ferms or bracken. This changes the chemistry of the glass completey, to *potash-lime-silica*.
16% K20, 18% CaO and 50% Si02 (compared to 70% in soda lime glass)

*The problem they faced was one of melting point*. How do you get the melting point down to a reasonable level? Well, they added a lot of ash but that made the glass *much* lesss durable. Any glass where Si02 falls below 60% is much more delicate - the structure goes from crystalline to amorphous.

###Blue
In 1000AD + 1900 there were 6-7 sources of Cobalt. The blue glass in the Church mentioned above is richer in sodium and silicon, which means it's less corroded than the other glass. It is of course taken from Roman places, Theophillius (writing in 1100AD) commented on the practice of melting moasaics, so I guess there was no source of Cobalt in 11th C.

###Red
Red was a trixy colour. One way to acheive it was 'flashing'. Having a very thin layer of red on a white layer, stretching it out into a cylinder before rolling it into a sheet. The red iron layer is about 100-200 micron thick. (the Fe layer is quite opaque)

Pre 1400 there were many layers in this process, but post 1400 there was only one (generally)

###York Minster
John Thornton was in charge of the glass, working bettern 1405-1408. We know this because he was given a patent, the first of its kind! He was the first person to make coloured glass in England. ("Said arte has never been used in England")

The coloured murrey glass (deep purple red) has a very different chemical compoisiton to the white glass however - so maybe the coloured glass by John Thornton was imported.

English White glass was made in the Weal and in Staffordshire.

## Decorated Wall tiles, Turkey

Now this is a slightly different kettle of fish, because here we are dealing with a pourous ceramic with a glass glaze.
The chinease were making poreceline, and it was very good (the best porceline is tranparent). The Chinease exported this to the Islamic world, where it was replicated.
In Iran are the first ceramics where blue is painted on white (possibly).

Everyone wanted to imitate porceline.
In comes Iznick ware, 15th century Turkey (and still very much alive and kicking today)

Abul Qasium wrote down some receipies in 1301, which stipulated 10 parts quarts, 1 part glass and 1 part clay. They tried to keep the clay down and quarts up, so as to keep a pale material. This is called 'stonepaste'.
The glaze is rich in sodium, ash is believed to have been used from burning desert plants.

The lustre decorationw as acheived by painting with copper/siler compounds which were then heated.

Iznick ware tiles uses similar boron rich soda for their clay, which as a heavy trace element means they can be detected using some fancy pants tools. (spectroscopy)
