#Typeology of Change

- How do we identify the process of change?
- what are the main properties of objects that define change?
- what are useful ways of modelling and interpreting change?

## Risk & Rate
A *risk* is a the potential for a known hazard to happen, which has a likelhood to happen over time. Examples are theft, fire, terrorism ect ect.

A *rate* is the calculated amount for known pollutants to really start causing damage (like light)

One is known and is prevented, the other is not certain, but possible, and is also prevented

## Agents of deterioration!
  * temp
  * pests
  * RH/water
  * light
  * mould
  * fire
  * forces & natural disaters
  * pollutants / dust


## Units
There are only 5 (6ish) reall units out there, they are:

* Mass, M
* Temp, T
* Length, L
* Time, special character t
* Electrical current, A
* (light, lux)

##Non dimensional numbers.

Here we will look at three things

* Biot
* Deborah
* Arrhenius

## Deborah

Debora = tc / tp

       =  relaxation time / observational time

One thing to take from this is the pitch drop experiement. Tar is a solid, it just drips reaaaallly slowly. [the ninth watch](http://www.thetenthwatch.com/feed/)

Elastic - magnitude
Viscous - force

viscoelastic, is of course both. Take flubber, its elastic in a timescale of seconds, but viscous in a timescale of hours.

*Amorphous structure* (not crystalline) such as glass are thought to have deborah numbers. It's ALOT smaller than one, it would take milenmia for glass to actually distort at the bottom. Lead relaxation time is bigger than glass!

If the deborah number is smaller than one, its 'small' because it's then a fraction. Non dimensional numbers are generally compared with unity.

If deb < 1 - Observer sees material as changing
if deb > 1 - observer sees material as steady.

If of course depends on the observation time. If the observation time is now from the dinosours, the deb number for glass would probs be changing. If it's from 5 mins ago, it would not be!

One good example of this, is the classic work by Naun Gabo, 1927 construction in space with two cones !(gabo)[https://www.grossestreffen.org/files/marianne-viero/x54qby2iuyvyval6tlmuat32rqpmpzd4.jpg]

Do houses flow?

##Hydrolysis of cellulose
Cellulose is a monomer that is repeated multiple times, it has H bonds between the layers, this means it reacts with water and air. It *hydrolises!*

The polymer splits in two where they are connected with and O molecule. This of course makes the material very brittle and effects the absorbtion of visible light, creating a yellowing effect. **Pure cellulose does not go yellow, but it's constituent parts do**.

##[Arrenius equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation)
Often used to describe the relationship between the rate of reaction and the temperature.
K = Ae ^-a

It compares the activation energy of the reation to the available thermal energy

& = Eo / Rt
& = activation energy / thermal energy

(maybe the concept is a bit to simple, but I likes it.)

If thermal energy is bigger than activation energy, the reaction will happen, if its below 1, it wont.

## Porosity
Porosity exists in many different scales.
Porosity causes [capillarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_action).

so, an item is porous and it can then suck up water against the force of gravity, as long as the pours are larger than water the surface tension of the water is where it can do that (precise eh?)

On bricks, you often see white stuff - this is salt caused by water migration on pourosity.

This becomes a problem when you have an item with different pourosity - think glazed ceramics. The tile is very pouros and exposed, but the glaze is not. Water and salt try to escape but cant, reulting is degredation.

#### Corrosion
Iron && rust
Rust has a higher porosity than iron, so it holds more water and gets more rusty! It is a catalyst for more rust :(

Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) has less porosity than Al, which is why its cool, non-porous and non reactive enough to wrap our sandwiches in.

## [Biot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot_number)
This separates the processes of chemical change in objects into two realms, those dominated by surface phenomena, and those dominated by bulk phenomena.

Bi = hL / k

biot = surface transfer / bulk transfer

(time spent getting through the core or the object, as opposed to through the surface of the object)

if B < 1 the bulk is faster, so it will homogeously cool (it all cools at the same pace)

if B > 1 it will not cool homogeneously (different bits at different temps)

## Light
dynamics of colour change (especially in organic colour materials)

*What is lux?*
Lumns per square meter. It is the measure of light falling on a surface, designed to imitate the sensitivity of human vision (and so it excludes UV and IR).
Thus it is not a *true* representation of live received by heritage objects so should be treated with caution.

(if there are LEDS, they have stuff going on, and so lux meters should be updated)

Very often the shape of a fading graph has an exponential curve that plataues. Why is that?

They have Chromophore molecues which break down with exciting UV radiation. Why is does it take longer over time? Just think of Joseps lego example. In a grid of 9 blocks, if three blocks have faded, the likelihood of the sun hitting a block that has not faded has gone down - as there are less blocks that have not faded.

To be a good pigment you have to...

* Have at least one chromophore molecule
* absorb light in the visible spectrum
* have a long conjugated system (mixture of double and single bonds) that WON"T BREAK DOWN TO EASILY!

But there is other chemical change we don't really understand - why does vermillion go black?
---
Fading is a first order process - it depdends purely on the amount of chromophores exposed to light.

Van Gough was aware of the photo-sensitivity of his work 'the painting fades like a flower'

It is a self dependant reaction.

The opposit is a self catalytic reaction (like when rust gets rustier)

So to conclude:

- Debohrah - is it fast or slow?
- Arrhenius - how does it change with temp?
- biot - is it limited by the surface bulk phenomena
- porosity - to what agents is it porous?
- reaction order - does it depend on itself?
- inhomogenity - Do the components react similarly to changes?
