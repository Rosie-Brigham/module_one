#[Crowdsourcing in the Digital Humanities](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1447269/1/MTerras_Crowdsourcing%20in%20Digital%20Humanities_Final.pdf)

##is it reliable?
unsure....
Melissa Terras is Director of UCL Centre for Digital Humanities,


##What is the point?
- overview of what crowdsourcing is, nothing new there
- makes the point that in GLAM its often not a large crowd, but offered to those already engaged and often a small co-hort (surely all CS should be to communities who are engaged, I guess its just the scale)
-Australian Newspaper Digitisation Program  again used
- this paper puts a chronological history(ish) together of different attempts at crowdsourcing
- in 2010 increased, with public being asked to identify stuff
- old weather was successful at brining together a whole diverse range of people from across the world and across disciplines (resulting data is now being used by both scientists and
historians to understand both climate patterns and naval history)
- demonstrates through the transcribe bentham project how great it is at creating collborations
- Brabham states that the point is to "tasks the
crowd with helping to gather, organise, and collect information into a common source or format. ", however, all the projects mentioned there is little gathering and collecting, it is just sorting and organising.
- lightly touches on how it can improve visitors understanding of the colleciton, whilst quoting another author. mainly skates over very important statements she makes
- draws on "Institutional nervousness around crowdsourcing" when analysing ridge
- he does eventually look at engagement: we can see
that crowdsourcing in the humanities is about engagement, and encouraging a wide,
and different audience to engage in processes of humanistic enquiry, rather than
merely being a cheap way to encourage people to get a necessary job done.
- some of them have then turned their software open source
- anxiety around the reliability of input - esepcially around transcribing
-brings up the point that with cross collboration, what comes with lisencing, when other people generate the content, who owns the content?
- goes onto crowdfunding...

##What could be improved/ what does it miss out?



##Interesting facts to take away:
- crowdsourcing is not new (add to that technology just speeds up the process)

- thinking point - when the advantages are taken away, it becomes unethical (uber, mechanical turk) - this is often when paid for? when is it exploitation?

 the million pages from Old Weather from different archives; over 3 million
words transcribed by volunteer labour in the Transcribe Bentham project (Grint 2013)
from both UCL and the British Library; approximately one and a half thousand letters
transcribed in Soldier Studies (Soldier Studies 2014), which at a conservative estimate
must give at least half a million words of correspondence from the American Civil
War
