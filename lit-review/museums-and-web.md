##is it reliable?
possibbly - it is old (2011)

##What is the point?
- looks at the enjoyment users get out of the 'old weather' project - not from scientific knowledge, but relating to human experience
 on citezen science "All of the Citizen Science Alliance's projects start with well-defined tasks that answer a real research question", do humanities answer research question?
 how would heritage science change this - it is a mix between humanities and science, so unlike humanities one it would have a research question

- looks at how games engage visitors

- looks at how difficult game design can be, as your audicence is constantly changing - how can you garantee engagement?

##What could be improved/ what does it miss out?



##Interesting facts to take away:

"Firstly, web-based games effectively reach out beyond the walls of the institution and provide an experience of your content to an audience that can’t, or won’t, visit you"

"Common objectives for museum games include:

- To increase brand awareness for the museum.
- To entice non-visitors to come to the museum
- To engage players with museum themes or collections.
- To encourage visitors to the museum to familiarize themselves with the institution and exhibitions, including lesser-known areas, as in a scavenger hunt.
- To deepen enjoyment at the museum, especially for the novice. An example of a poorly articulated but common objective would be: “The visitor will have fun.” A better objective might be: “The visitor will believe that our museum is a fun place to be,” or “The visitor will believe that we offer fun experiences beyond this game.”
- To deepen observation of the collections and exhibition subject matter.
- To change visitor behavior in some way.
- To crowdsource museum needs, such as collections identification (Ridge, 2011).
