#[Building A Volunteer Community: Results and Findings from Transcribe Bentham](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/000125.html)

##is it reliable?
yes, UCL source?

##What is the point?
looks at the findings from bentham project, what worked and what did not ect.

- raises interesting question, crowd of community. Heavywieght vs lightweight - in which the former is lots of people, with little detail with differing levels of detail, the latter is less people but more detailed knowledge

##What could be improved/ what does it miss out?

this describes what the project was, and how it was set up. It provided an online portal for people to help transcribe benthams writings, to a good degree of success.

Different from my project - it is not location specific
it does not look at what the visitors took from the experience, and more from what they added.

interesting reults of the demographic of people taking part - well spread out over the ages. few had any training in transcribing, so ll unspecialist

A smaller number of volunteers contributed, however, the majority of the work, and noted as 'super transcribers' (there were six of them)

IT proficieny was a limiting factor however - so trascribing was not, but IT was.


##Interesting facts to take away:

"Crowdsourcing is becoming more widespread, and thus, it is important to understand exactly how, and if, it works. It is a viable and cost-effective strategy only if the task is well facilitated, and the institution or project leaders are able to build up a cohort of willing volunteers. "

 Transcribe Bentham has certainly made an impact on the academic community and libraries and archives profession; its progress has been tracked by JISC and the Institute of Historical Research, and it has been reviewed by the Higher Education Development Association, and the Higher Education Academy

 We found that Transcribe Bentham volunteers were mostly well educated, often associated with academia or had a professional background, and had a prior interest in history and philosophy; many of the crowd also had an interest in digital humanities and were IT literate, but few were associated with schools.

 Transcribe Bentham, for example, was gaining momentum just as it was obliged to scale back owing to the nature of the AHRC grant; editors were unable to provide the detailed feedback to volunteers as they had done previously.
