# [Is the heritage really important? A theoretical framework for heritage reputation using citizen sensing](http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S0197397514000988)

##is it reliable?
yes? it's been cited...


##What is the point?

- This paper proposes a theoretical framework for heritage reputation
- The framework includes the crowd/citizen sensing as an alternative data source.
- states that heritage has value, which changes over time
- referes to citizens of the world as a network of sensors, who data can be captured.
- uses EH (historic england) value cycle, and analyses the different charters over time to extablish a basis of value
- this specifically focuses on **REPUTATION**
- focuses specifially on personal location data, looking at using users geospatial data (volunteered but not for that specific purpose) to create relevance maps. (much like twitter and natural disaters)
- is quite vauge as the the ACTUALY framework

- very wooly, with little idea for implementation - a lot to be worked on methinks (but I guess a good starting point)


##What could be improved/ what does it miss out?

- this paper can be used to segway into the idea of citizen science for heritage valuation and collection demography

- talks about data over time - but peoples use of technology will change over time and therefore the data they create will as well - in this quick changing enviromnet it's difficult to base a framework on what there is today, as tomorrow it may change. Flikr may no longer exist...


##Interesting facts to take away:
- it references web 2.0
