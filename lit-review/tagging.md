is it reliable?
yes

What is the point?

- argues that crowdsourcing is a good way to engage people with cultural heritage
- has several definitions of 'engagement'
- she argues that it has its place
- suggests OED definition does not provide scope for the value of crowdsourcing in CH situations
- museums confuse corwsourcing with user generated content (maybe show what the difference is)
- there is a long tradition of volunteering in CH, (you could bring in a NT example)
- what is the difference between citezen science and citezen history
- "crowdsourcing as we know it has been transformed by technology, but not created by it. Digital technology is able to provide almost instantaneous data-gathering and feedback, automatic validation, and the ability to reach both broad and niche groups through loose networks"
- it focuses on what the projects are, but not he impact on the participants, would be interesting to consider that
- coins the term 'digital volunteers' for intentional participants

It is well argued?

What does it reveal?

- success of scaffolding projects in desgin, to demonstrate simplicity is key
- engagement is drawn from enjoyment, community and participation in real science
- CH projects are well placed for alturism
- "Currently, most successful crowdsourcing games are focused on microtasks like tagging, validating data, or transcribing small sections of content within larger collections." - so annotating data, not CREATING data
- interface design is key
- what is engagement: DCMS - attending, participating, deciding and producing

she establishes that is certainly has its place, but does not look at data creation, and what findings could be drawn from the data creation of public engagement apart from the base value.
(so, why do visitors engage with this bit - looking at the big data when they are contributing metat data OR using them to create their own data) - would this be user generated content? how does it differ? look at that


What could be improved?

- what is the difference between citezen science and citezen history
- she skates over what scaffolding is


Interesting facts to take away:
"in mid-June 2013, the Oxford English Dictionary—itself an example of proto-crowdsourcing—included the term “crowdsourcing” for the first time. The OED definition: “The practice of obtaining information or services by soliciting input from a large number of people, typically via the Internet and often without offering compensation.”"

“Crowdsourcing” was coined in 2006 when Jeff Howe and Mark Robinson riffed on the term “outsourcing”

"Currently, most successful crowdsourcing games are focused on microtasks like tagging, validating data, or transcribing small sections of content within larger collections." -


- what are the lines between user generated content and crowdsourcing? How do they differ in what contexts
- focused in general, not on specifics - so we can ask, what can it do for conservation in spefici?
