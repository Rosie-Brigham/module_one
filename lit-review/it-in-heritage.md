#[ICT adoption in heritage organizations: Crossing the chasm ](http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S0148296316302569)

##is it reliable?
journal of buisness research, 2016,

good source, analysed a number of museums across western europe to measure the amount of adoption
certainly relevant when looking at digital ways to use crowdsourcing
looked at france spain and portuagal, as there is a high instance in cutural heritage for economy there.

good example to look at one aspect.


##What is the point?
- looks at how western museums have taken up digital technologies

Important when talking about engagement, but not nessicarily completely relevant?


##What could be improved/ what does it miss out?



##Interesting facts to take away:

- ICT is a source of innovation and development (quoted from someone else)
- heritage institutions prefer to stay in the comfort zone (I guess experimentation is expensive), use is incremental

"Despite the omnipresence of ICT in contemporary society, ICT adoption within heritage organizations is growing slowly and often remains limited to a basic website and a simple Facebook page, associated with the classic low-tech audio guides (Gonzalez, Llopis, & Gasco, 2015). Even the use of ICT as part of the visiting experience does not seem to have reached a high degree of maturity to be of significant relevance for visitors and is accepted within a traditional conception of what a museum is (Rey & Casado-Neira, 2013)."

only 'superstar' heritage organisations really invest in dynamic ict things

most have websites, all up to date - as this is very important for visitors.

"Pragmatic heritage organizations invest in more accessible and mainstream digital technologies, such as social media and interactive applications. Despite their lack of resources or other managerial constraints, these organizations develop simple sponsorships with accessible companies and use common technologies, such as Facebook or Twitter, in a very creative way that enables overcoming limitations and maximizing benefits."

"For pragmatic heritage organizations, ICT is a modern and effective way of promoting art and culture among all audiences, especially younger ones. Information about exhibits and events is quickly updated and widely disseminated. " - THIS COULD BE CROWDSCOURING!

"Existing teams don't have the necessary skills and training to elaborate a digital strategy, implement the corresponding tools, manage their use and maintenance, and provide appropriate and meaningful content.

"Visionary heritage organizations believe that technology doesn't alter or denature artifacts or monuments. They emphasize that the understanding of the work's message is more important than physically seeing the objects or being in the heritage environment. Digital technology is a tool separate from the heritage but becomes a medium to disseminate and even embody the heritage, as is the case for the Artium Museum, Vitoria, Spain:"

rapid obsolescences highlighted as a problem

**ICT adoption of heritage organizations is categorized in 3 types: conservatives, pragmatics and pioneers. Heritage organizations adopt ICT to achieve each of their missions: artifacts digitalization, audience development and heritage promotion. Despite this strategic need, factors restraint adoption: risk of heritage denaturation; perception of a lack of purpose; lack of budget; lack of skills; slow decision making inadequate to rapid technology obsolescence; content issues; difficulty to maintain the equipment.**
