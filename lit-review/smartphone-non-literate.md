# [Smartphone Icon User Interface design for non-literate trackers and its implications for an inclusive citizen science](http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S0006320716301707)

##is it reliable?
Yes - peer reviewed journal


##What is the point?
- uses citizen science in remote areas to track animals and measure biodiversity
- getting hunter gatheres to use smart devices to track and record animals - via icons (as non literate), demonstrates that it's all about UX design.
- it was successful because the participants gained knowledge from it, they felt ownership over the technology and learned and enjoyed it.
- paper uses interviews to back this up (other papers have not thus far)


##What could be improved/ what does it miss out?
- it is a good overview, uses a wide variety of sources and lay outs its findings in a clear way. Importatly it also references the users themselves, and what they gained from the experience, which helps the reader understand why they did it in the first place.

- it is not really relevant to heritace science, but demonstrates a different use case, and shows how it can be applied across cultures.


##Interesting facts to take away:
Claim that charles Darwin was an ametuer citizen scientist
