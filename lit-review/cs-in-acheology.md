##is it reliable?
yes-ish (one citation)


##What is the point?
- again, this is another overview praising that corwdsourcing is a good tool for archeologist, and has been used in a variety of ways


##What could be improved/ what does it miss out?



##Interesting facts to take away:
mass data efforts still generally remain reliant on collection input and management by professionals.


Citizen
science is distinct from other types of volunteered
or compiled information (such as blogs or web
feeds) because of data-collection protocols
through which participants are informed about
the scope, goals, and outcomes of the research
and actively become partners in the scientific enterprise - Haklay 2013:107


Many citizenscience
efforts do, however, deliberately engage
in “instant online gratification” to encourage participants
and validate inputs, with virtual “badges,”
opportunities for competition, and feedback popups
that mimic elements of online gaming

(a recent example being Hanny
van Arkel, a Dutch schoolteacher whose discovery
of a distinct gas cloud through the Internet
project Galaxy Zoo led to her being listed as a
coauthor in numerous scholarly papers, e.g., Keel
et al. 2012)

looking for interstellar dust particles
Although the site frankly advises volunteers that
there are likely to be only about a dozen particles
in the collection of over a million images, the
project has logged over 21,000 volunteers who
have undertaken image searches.


A participatory citizen science framework addresses
two of the most pressing problems in archaeological
research: insufficient professional
personnel relative to the number of historical and
archaeological sites, and the outdated mode of
unidirectional knowledge transmission from professionals
to the public
