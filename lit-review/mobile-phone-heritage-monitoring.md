# [Crowd-sourced Mobile Phone Images for Heritage Conservation Monitoring](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7413847)

[text here](/text/07413847.pdf)

##is it reliable?
possibly

##What is the point?
- argues that phone cameras can be use to monitor built heritage
- " We propose using crowd-sourced images from mobile phones to create a fine- grained, time-stamped, and geolocated image dataset of calibrated color images"
- use the dataset to create time lapse movies
- actually involes audience participation through taking picture
- talks about computation to automatically register and correct images
- refers to it as 'Citezen Science' - which seems relevant
- uses an app, to get the visitor to take pictures at a specific point
0 touches lightly (one sentance) on creating a game for engagement
- they calibrate the images accordingly, and use images to specifically measure colour
- does it actually mention which phones they used?

##What could be improved/ what does it miss out?
- they don't mention which phones were used, this is annoying really...

##Interesting facts to take away:
- refers to it as 'Citezen Science' - which seems relevant, involgin particiaptns to actively contribute, instead of passively engage
