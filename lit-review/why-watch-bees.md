# [Why watch bees? Motivations of citizen science volunteers in the Great Pollinator Project](http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S0006320716303238)




##is it reliable?
yes - biological conservation, peer reviewed


##What is the point?
- this should be used to see how people analyse participants reasons for participating
- alludes to the idea that it enables the public to get invovled with sicence, and feel like scientists
- though volutneers in general motivations have been stutided, citizen scientists have not, and suggests that the motivations may be outside the aulturistic or egotistic
- demographics (white, female over 50)
- again, they back up their findings with quotes from paticipants, which make the peice more engaging
- top engagement was related to learning and values, not nessecarily pure alturism
- used surveys to improve engagement in next year activities, good agile approach
- it is important to make the significance of the contribution specific
- engaged with people who signed up, but didn't collboarte, which proved very useful for continuing the project and understanding why people WONT do the work


reasons -
mainly wanted to learn about bees (27)
wanted to be in conservation project (14)
attracting polinators to garden (14)
concern about colony collapse disorder (12)
want to improve green parks and spaces (12)
social factors (4)


one third - desrie to learn about the subject (bees)
11% about being outdoors and (11) contributing to science


##What could be improved/ what does it miss out?



##Interesting facts to take away:
". There is tremendous opportunity, with the emergence of the Citizen Science Association and other networks across disciplines and geographies, to connect citizen science project coordinators to enrich understanding and adapt approaches."
