#[Next steps for citizen science](http://science.sciencemag.org.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/content/343/6178/1436)

##is it reliable?
yes, I believe so


##What is the point?
- not generally accepted as valid scientific investigation (difficulty getting reviewed)
-overview of what has been acheived, and how long for (article for a magazine so quite light)
- there are many projects, but many arn't really 'new' - there is a lot of repetition (good example of this is zoonisverse)

looks towards a graph type structure of sharing data from projects, very easily written as a magazine journal

##What could be improved/ what does it miss out?



##Interesting facts to take away:
"Creating projects to achieve social and scientific objectives requires deliberate design that is attentive to diverse interests, including why and how members of the public would even want to be involved"

"Most citizen science projects work independently, and many citizen science data sets containing a wealth of information are unknown or unavailable to decision-makers. The process of making these data accessible and usable as a tool for meeting some of science and society's grand challenges would be facilitated by organizing around citizen science centers"
