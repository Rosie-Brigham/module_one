](http://search.proquest.com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/docview/1625138467?rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo)

##is it reliable?
unsure...


##What is the point?
- again, and overview of crowdsourcing in cultural heritage
- looks at increased online access
- focuses on US projects
- states it's useful for institutions where there is a lack of paid staff (does that become problematic?)
- future is taggin audio or GIS - focuses on 'citezen archivists', very different from citizen scientists.


##What could be improved/ what does it miss out?
- looks very breifly at the ways to engage people, but does not atcually analyse them
- does not think of the problems where work is expected to be done by volunteers - does not consider what benefits the visitor should gain, definately the wrong attitude.
- states that a hurdle is quality control.



##Interesting facts to take away:
Library_of_Congress in US used flicker to tag and identify images, they found many more people on

NARA's Citizen Archivist Dashboard, again, editing articles, tagging images and uploading. Crowdsourcing a way to 'harness researcher knowledge'. THey found that lower res images were useless.

Smithsonian transcription center (transcription.si.edu), again - looking at transcription. Introduced quality control - transcription by volunteers, review by users, final approval by in house volunteers.

The NYPL's Labs - 'kill time, make history'
