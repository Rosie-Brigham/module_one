Zooniverse - where you can create your own - this relies on users identifying data already presented, what can we take from that? how does conservation data differ? how can people become engaged in mould?


Citizen scientist, crowdsourcing and citizen archivist - each of these are loaded terms and should be deconstructed. Many lit sources put the institution first - surely it should also focus on the benefit of the user and what the user acn bring to the table other than just 'mouse clicks?'


it is a new field, but what if the citizens get bored of it? (is it such a new field, i guess its only enw in the widescale that can be achieved through internet(web) technologies)

think about how this is a set toward the semantic web (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web#Web_3.0) in which the future is of data sharing in a Giant Global Graph instead of consuming on the World Wide Web.
