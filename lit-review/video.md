developing crowdsourcing tasks isn't a cheap answer, because you have to plan carefully. It needs to be well designed

generally - more sucessful - training is implicit - small steps to complexity

enjoyable puzzle

bl map project - complete before th PR

reluctance to link FB - choose the right platform for the right audience

niche projects are effetive

motivations as design guidelines - who is doingthis and why

how do you report success - what will you measure - it will effect behaviour

defineing impact by engagement - YES! if you tag an image, you spend longer with it - you are engaging and interacting with that image, you have a relationship with it. The same with transribing handwriting. Some projects where people go on to research what is behind the text they transcribe - there is something that gets them more interested and they develop a new relationship.
uses herbaria home, looking at label specimens. People transcribing started seeing the same handwriting, so they looked at different people collecting where - Jane smith colelcting on this day, and in the next week collected again in a different country" - this project adapted to deal with the interests develped by the citizens as interest deepend in the human stories behind the labels. It gave the particianpts a whole new interest and a new set of skills, and very much bonded over the experience. If we think back to the National Trust - its about having acup of tea, sitting down and communicating with people, being part of something that is bigger than yourself.


particiapsnt for ships created an INTENSE documentation for how to translate different types of handwriting for other participants


being online - you can 'lurk'


participants are savvy - so there is a lot of pressure on the design - design is a part of recuritment - onboarding in the process.
design for casual and super users, for experts and for newbies.

The only way to know if it's working is to allow time to iterate (bring in lean startup)



WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE DATA?, so important to think, because you want to show people you care about their contributions.
