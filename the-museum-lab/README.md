#Heritage Science in the Museum
**David Sanders, head of Science at BM**

Most museums have preservation and engagement baked into their core values; presentation and preservation; 'for ever, for everyone'.

Thus, making sure they last long is quite important!

Non-invasive (non contact) preservation methods

* no sample taken
* no damage to the area examinde (visually, although with some methods we are unsure of the long term effects so a bit hazy here)

Invasive

* Destructive
  * sample removed from the object for analysis
  * sample is then destroyed in during the analysis process
* Non-destructive
  * sample is removed from the object for analysis
  * sample is not destroyed during analysis and thus available for future (like paint cross sections)

Examples of the first one:

* Visible light
* Visible induced luminescence
* UV induced luminsecence (showing things like previous restorations)
* Infrared reflected imagine (IR, showing underdrawings of paintings)
* X-ray flourescence, (XRF, shows the whole makeup of the painting)
* Optical Coherence Technology (OCT, scans the top layers, looks a bit like a cross section of the top layers)
* Raman
* FTIR - foriur transform infro red
* Fiber optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS, this gets info about colours used in one paticular area)

(QUESTION: when would you use FTIR over IR? When would you use Raman over another one?)

Back to invasive, when sampling - what is the risk vs the benefit? and will the sample effect the aesthetic impact?

*Egyptian Blue*
This is a 3rd Mil BC synthesised pigment,  found in egyptian and Greek paintings in the Roman period up to the 8th century AD.
Then it all goes quiet and the skill is lost, unle 1893 at a world fair and a **new** method of syntesising the pigment is reported for the first time.

Finding this pigment is a nice way to date stuff I guess.

###Direct Investiagion (testing the component)

####Smalt
See ![alt text](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/server.iip?FIF=/fronts/N-5467-00-000028-WZ-PYR.tif&CNT=1.0&WID=800&HEI=800&QLT=85&CVT=jpeg "The Sons of Boreas pursuing the Harpies"). This bad boy is covered in smalt, isn't that great?! Smalt of course reacts to the binding medium.

However, when a sample was tested with SEM, it turns out that the silicon and the cobalt were still there (it was thought the cobalt was 'leeched' out). However, the was not potassium, this it was the loss of potassium that causes the discolouration (there was a 10% loss of K but only a 2% loss of cobalt).

Used prussian blue.

##Indirect investiagtion
things to consider are:

* suseptibility to the environment (hey, is this thing offgassing?)
* Analyisi and monitoring of surrounding objects
* Analysis of materials for sorage display and packing
* Analysis and testing conservation materials and techniques.

eg, classifying materials with suseptibility to light. Bring in the blue wool!

Microfadeomotry is a pretty cool way of doing this - it fades a really small section of a painting - so small you can't see it.

Some degredations are exponential. For example, as a paper degrades it becomes acidic, this acidity then further attacks the paper. Oh noes!

*How about remove all the all the oxegen?*
This is great for some things, like Alizarin, however its really rubbish with things like Prussian blue.

[How about the Oddy test?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddy_test) (put things in ovens and see what happens)

Black dyed objects:
These can be bad as the iron in the dye reacts with the tannin, and so the dye can 'eat'the substrate. This is possibly due to the chloride ions. how do we desaliniate it? (unkown at present)

*Strategy * comes into play quite heavily when dealing with science in the museum environment. Not everything can be done at once, so things need to be carefully planned. Though you can never plan for when someone writes on a Rothko.
