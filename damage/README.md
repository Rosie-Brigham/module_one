#Damage & Change
Matija

"The term 'damage' should be used where there is a permanent and noticible loss in value or potential" - J Ashley Smith

* Major structural damage
* minor structural damage
* surface damage
* disfigurment
* chemical deterioration
* biological attack
* bad previous repairs

What are the properties or heritage? It is certainly not just sight - think of the things that are intrinsic to gardens, library musical instruments ect.

"we are not convinced that no change is acceptable" - however, how do we judge the acceptability of change? There are many stakeholders in place: conservators, visitors, managers ect.

Is the absence of book smell damage?
If you de-acdify the books, you stop them ageing, but then you loose the 'old book smell'.

Also, how do we know what properties of an object will be valuble in the future?

We preserve damaged material, as testement to its history (such as bomb blast marks on the V&A)

Condition assements are often made using incomplete information, and subjective information. They are driven by proposed future use.

'condition' is a very loaded term and must be carefully defined.
What is meant by 'fitness for purpose'? How do heritage objects purposes change?

Focult [what is an autho](http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/Gustafson/FILM%20162.W10/readings/foucault.author.pdf) is very relevant in this context.

What is an acceptable level of change and how can that be calculated across a population?
