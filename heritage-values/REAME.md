#Heritage Values
###Monday 24th October, Kalliopi Fouseki

The "ultimate aim of conservation is not to conserve material for its own sake, but, rather to maintain (and shape) the values embodied by the heritage"

"values are those qualities regarded by a person, group or community as important and desireable"

Economics of Values:
Because heritage management is a growing feild, this has not really had much critical attention and has only really been redefined in the past 5 years or so.

Are values a social construct?
(yes. obviously.)

Who perscribes values?
(the ruling class?)

As conservators/museum oracticioners we must ask, "what are we doing, how are we doing it, why are we doing it and for whom".
And then we can sit in a dark coner and moan about the terrible pain in all the diodes down your my left side.

A couple of definitions for no however:

*Intrinsic value* is when the value is inherent within the resource, for example to content of the text in a book.

*Extrinsic value* is when it is judged to have a wider social, cultural or personal value; Charles Darwins cane for example. (this is arguable more subjective than the other one, and there is a lot of debate about what can be defined as which)

Uniqueness is a value, and so sites that are unique have an intrinsic value. The battle ground lies over prioritising some values over others. At the end of the day, its generally the amount of people who give a shit that matter, and of course whoever is in charge of the money. They will ultimately make the decision and so hold allllll the power, irrelevant wether it has a lot of value to a lot of people or not.

How do we find out values? Create focus groups I guess.

There are a lot of value typeologies that attempt to classify value types in heritage, but, in my opinion, they are all to wooly and bullshit to really be bothered with. There is however, a handout if you want to check it. These 'charters' are not legal documents, more guildlines to attempt to address hat ia meant by heritage values.

What would be the different values of a heritage object in a living community vs heritage as a visitor attraction?

Mount Athos. We take it at dawn.
