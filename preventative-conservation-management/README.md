#Preventative Conserservation Management
**J BG, 19th October**

Many preservation guidelines derive from the [Canada Institute](http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1444330943476), mainly as they were the first really in depth source to be made available online.

**Particles**:

When considering the guidelines, in reference to particles (and any reference to particles in a preventative conservation context), what kind of particles are they referring to? Dust? Metal? Skin? Fibers from clothing? What size come to that? - these types of questions sometimes reveal limitations of guidelines.

[guidelines](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/df/df5c504d10c538e4c5b88e308206a324ed6c0fcff9e54a3e131fc3c17aff7464.jpg)

Air composition is just 0.05% Other Stuff (aside from Ni, O2 & Ar)
Within that 0.05 there be CO2, o3, NO3 and others....
So thats quite a Small Amount.

PM, or particle matter in which the particles measure less that 10ppm in diamter (1000000 micrometers) is likely to affect health.

*Course* PM you can see with your eye, bit *fine* is smaller that a visible light wavelength, thus it is only with magnification that is can be seen.
*Ultrafine* contains practically no mass, but there are generally loads of them (smoke ect).

Stains around radiators for example, are geerally from ultrafine particles that are made when coarse particles break down when the radiator is heated up.

When thinking about pollution:

###National Gallery!
"6 tonnes of solid matter consisting of soot and tarry hydrocabons are deposited every week on every quarter of a suqare mile inside of London"

High pollution leads to dirt, discolouration, chemical damage, abrasive soiling and acid rain.

Carbon coverage needs to be only 3.6% to be visible.

Fun fact, it could be said that Michael Faraday (1791 - 1867) was the father of Heritage Science. He did research into wether the NG should be moved, that the transcript of his deliery of the report to the House of Commons, is quite englightening. They really try to get a reccomendation out of him, but he really wants to stik to the scientific facts.

An example of preventative conservation when catastrophic degredation is imminent, is of course when they moved the whole load of paintings to a cave in Wales during the blitz.

Another example of this is the **Altamira Caves**, which have been closed to the public since the 70's where signs of microbial growth were found on the drawings. Now only 5 people can visit per week. Pretty cool stuff I think.

**Wellington Arch** is a pretty polluted place, and so 3-4% carbon coverage on the display cases daily! This was due to a air duct from the underpass below the arch. In these cases health guidelines can be used to deinfe about of particles that should be present.
For large ones, PM2.5, and PM10 for fine.
