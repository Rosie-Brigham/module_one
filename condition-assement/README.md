Remener that a *hazard* is the Bad Thing. A *risk* is the probability of the Bad Thing from happening.

“Scientists have calculated that the chances of something so patently absurd actually existing are millions to one.
But magicians have calculated that million-to-one chances crop up nine times out of ten.”
(not really applicable but funny)

A Risk Assesment is a combination of *hazard identification*, *risk analysis*, *risk description* and *risk estimation*.

It is difficult without prior study to know the deterioration process in a collection - which is why research can help us asses these things.

What we know:
The object *will* finally degrade
Most likely this will be helped with the presence of oxegen and temperature.

So there have to be some processes that will take place No Matter What.

**Catastrophic Degredation**:

There is a certain probability that a catastrophe will occure (such as fire, flooding, landslide, earthquake, theft, terrorism)
These need to be calculated and planned for accordingly.

So here we have to include ongoing deterministic rate with catastrophic event risk.

The **Magnitude of Risk** is the sum of all the possibilities, and this will demonstrate where investment needs to be made.

Idea to ponder on:
"We loose a sense of touch in museum and gallery spaces, with digitisation do we loose our sight as well?"
